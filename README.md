# MovieProject
This Kotlin project uses [TheMovieDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) for listing popular movies. In this app, you can see up to date popular movies, have information about them, add your favorites to your list and search for any movie you wish.

This app uses Paging3 library for endless scroll through movies, MVVM architecture, DI with Hilt, Retrofit, Room for adding favorite movies to database and Glide for loading images.

You can clone this project, get your API key from the TheMovieDB site, replace your key in the project and check it out.
